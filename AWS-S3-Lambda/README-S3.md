# ServerlessWorkshop - AWS S3 Object Storage

S3 is an AWS service for storing objects, it can be used for storing and serving up files.

It is a backend service but we treat it here as it is a common BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service) which we will use to augment a Serverless application.

## Creating an AWS Account
