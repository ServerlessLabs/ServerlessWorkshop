      "       There are two types of path arguments: LocalPath and S3Uri.\n",
      "\n",
      "       LocalPath: represents the path of a local file or directory.  It can be\n",
      "       written as an absolute path or relative path.\n",
      "\n",
      "       S3Uri: represents the location of a S3 object, prefix, or bucket.  This\n",
      "       must  be  written in the form s3://mybucket/mykey where mybucket is the\n",
      "       specified S3 bucket, mykey is the specified S3 key.  The path  argument\n",
      "       must  begin with s3:// in order to denote that the path argument refers\n",
      "       to a S3 object. Note that prefixes are separated  by  forward  slashes.\n",
      "       For  example, if the S3 object myobject had the prefix myprefix, the S3\n",
      "       key would be myprefix/myobject, and if the object  was  in  the  bucket\n",
      "       mybucket, the S3Uri would be s3://mybucket/myprefix/myobject.\n",

      "       Every  command  takes  one or two positional path arguments.  The first\n",
      "       path argument represents the source, which is the local  file/directory\n",

      "       For  this  type of operation, the first path argument, the source, must\n",
      "       exist and be a local file or S3 object.  The second path argument,  the\n",
      "       destination,  can  be  the  name  of  a local file, local directory, S3\n",
